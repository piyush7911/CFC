## Description

SkillFusion Extractor streamlines the recruitment process by addressing inefficiencies and biases in traditional 
resume screening. Recruiters often face challenges with large volumes of unstructured resume data, leading to delays 
and poor candidate selections. The AI-powered system automates screening and improves candidate-job matching by 
analyzing resumes and job descriptions, ensuring accurate and objective hiring decisions. Resumes in various 
formats are processed alongside job descriptions, initiating workflows for resume preprocessing and job requirement 
analysis. The system extracts essential information from resumes, stores it in a database, and performs keyword and 
semantic analysis to match candidates with job roles.

Using advanced models like IBM Watsonx Flow Engine and Llama 3-70b, SkillFusion Extractor assigns weights to job 
criteria, analyzes competencies, and provides deep insights into each candidateâ€™s qualifications. This enhances 
recruitment by offering a holistic view of candidates' strengths and suitability, displayed through a user-friendly 
dashboard. By automating data extraction, matching, and competency profiling, the system reduces time to shortlist 
candidates, minimizes bias, and promotes data-driven decisions. Ultimately, it helps recruiters make faster, 
more informed hiring choices, improving the overall quality of hires.
